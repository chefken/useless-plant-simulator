# USELESS PLANT SIMULATOR üéØ
A quirky and humorous virtual plant simulator built with Python and Tkinter.


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Name]

### Project Description
[2-3 lines about what your project does]
This is a lighthearted and silly virtual plant simulator where you care for a randomly chosen plant species. You can water, give sunlight, fertilize, or do nothing, and watch how your plant's health changes in unpredictable ways. The plant even responds with funny messages and random "status" updates, making this more of a fun little experiment than a serious game.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
Trying to grow a plant

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
Designed a unique way to grow a plant by preparing the user to face all unexpected methods on how a plant could die.
